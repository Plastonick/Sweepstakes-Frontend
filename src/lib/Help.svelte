            This bot posts to your Slack or Discord channel for any match event during the World Cup.
            <br>
            Events include
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Match Starting</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Goal Scored</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Goal Disallowed</strong></li>
            <li>and <strong>Match Finishing</strong> events <i>(declaring the winner, or if the match were drawn)</i></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Using this service requires generating some data, and deciding on some configuration values for your use case
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Webhook</strong> is an incoming webhook you'll need to generate for your <a
                href="https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks">Slack</a> or <a
                href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks">Discord</a> channel. <small>This
                allows the bot to post to your channel, and is used as a key to fetch your configuration later to update it. If
                you no longer want the bot to post to your channel, you can re-enter your webhook and DELETE the configuration,
                or simply re-generate the webhook URL from your service which will void the old webhook</small></li>
            <li><strong>Service</strong> is either Slack or Discord, this should be selected automatically when you enter your
                webhook
            </li>
            <li><strong>Emoji</strong> should be a comma separated list of emoji which will be randomly selected to be used in
                any messages for their event. Emoji can either be the emoji character ðŸ«¡, or the string alias e.g. <i>custom_emoji</i>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Teams</strong> should be the name of the person allocated to each team, this can either be</li>
            <ul>
                <li>a <strong>tagged identifier</strong>, these are detected by a prefixed @. For Slack this should look
                    something like @fbloggs and for Discord this will be their <a
                        href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/discord-id?r=US&IR=T">Discord user ID</a> e.g.
